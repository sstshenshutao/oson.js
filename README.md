oson.js
==========

A CommonJS module that compiles [OSON](https://github.com/sstshenshutao/oson) to JSONSchema
------------------------------------------------------
> __oson__ is a micro-language to describe the schema of JSON. It allows you to write down the JSON and the schema of JSON inside only one file(with annotation). oson is a subset of JSON-Schema, so it can be compiled to JSON-schema, it is inspired by "orderly" and annotation.
